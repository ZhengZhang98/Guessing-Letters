# Guessing-Letters
Guessing the random letters given by the computer with clues. Find out who can get the highest score!
There are three levels for this simple game, which are 5,7 and 9 letters to guess with the maximum score 500, 700 and 900 separatedly. The letters given by the computer will never be the same and what you need to guess is not only the letters but also the positions of the letters. After every guess, you will get the clues about the number of right letters and position, but also 10 minus for every wrong guess. Good luck!
